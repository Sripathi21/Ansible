ansible_ installation

-> Launch Amazon Linux (no need to install ansible s/w in hosts)
-> yum install wget -y
-> wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
-> yum install epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm -y
-> sudo yum update -y
-> sudo yum install git python python-devel python-pip openssl ansible -y
-> ansible --version

*  once installing ansible software ansible folder got created
   /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
*  inventory file information will be available inside of ansible.cfg in a commented position
   # vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
   delete comment inventory=/etc/ansible/hosts
   delete comment sudo_user=root
*  inside of hosts file we create one group and enter private ip adresses of the hosts
   # vi  /etc/ansible/hosts
   example: [webservers]
           172.31.41.247
           172.31.37.173
